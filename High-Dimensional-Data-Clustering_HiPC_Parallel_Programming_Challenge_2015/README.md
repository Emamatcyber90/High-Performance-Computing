Instructions on Compiling:

Run the following commands on the bash prompt:

I. Move into the src folder inside the Vertigo_intel_phase2 folder in the extracted folder. (Vertigo was our team name)

        $cd Vertigo_intel_phase2/src/

II. Run the following command on the bash prompt to run the makefile to build the executables:

	$make

III. An executable will thus be formed with the name ‘a.out’

IV. Place your input CSV file in the same folder with the name ‘input.csv’

V. Run the following command on the bash prompt to print the output in an ASCII file in CSV format.

        $./a.out > output.csv
