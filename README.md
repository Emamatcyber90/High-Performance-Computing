# High-Performance-Computing
This repository is dedicated to my course work on the DA-IICT course CS301: High Performance Computing. 

This repository contains three directories, namely Lab\ Work/ which is my collection of Lab Submissions undertaken as part of the course; 'High-Dimensional-Data-Clustering_HiPC_Parallel_Programming_Challenge_2015', which contains my team's submission in the Intel-Nvidia Parallel Programming Challenge as part of the High Performance Computing Conference Conference, Bangalore 2015, where my team comprised of myself, S. Chaitanya Prasad (@chaitanya94) and Visharad Bansal (@visharad-05); and my project submission for the course which was also on the same topic as the parallel programming challenge but this folder contains a much more detailed analysis.

Today, nearly all computing systems including mobile phones, laptops, desktops, supercomputers, and large-scale data centers are being built using multiple-cors processors.
Unlike the past, today almost all increases in system performance come from increased parallelism rather than increase in clock frequency. 
This shift to multi-core chips affects all segments of the IT industry and all areas of Computer Science.
To efficiently work with these multi-core processors the users should acquire parallel programming and High Performance Computing (HPC) skills.
HPC is also a key driver in the field of data science. This course was an introduction to parallel computing and aims at teaching basic models of parallel programming including the principles of parallel algorithm design, parallel computer architectures, 
programming models for shared and distributed-memory systems, message passing programming models used for cluster computing along with some important algorithms for parallel systems.
